# Old Watcom Projects (16-bit)

This repository contains some of my old Watcom projects from 2019 year, which are ugly written. The purpose of this repository is to archive them here on GitHub.

## What is included in this repo?

Four most interesting (after years) projects that deserved archiving on GitHub:

* `ASCIIConverter` (being simple 1250 ANSI to 852 ASCII converter),
* `Charmap_DOS` (being simple charmap display),
* `Eksperyment6` (meaning Experiment 6; being simple inline assembly experiment and sound generation program)
* `FoxCodeConverter_DOS` (being my very simple encoding algorithm implementation).

## What to use to compile this codes?

The codes provided here were made to compile using Open Watcom IDE, which is quite good for modern MS-DOS/WfW3.11 development.
It's possible that they would compile using old Microsoft compilers, but I haven't tested it. It's best to use Watcom for them.
In fact, these projects are heavily tied to Watcom coding style, so I think there might be serious problems with compiling them outside such environment.

## Disclaimer

I've made much effort to provide here working and checked codes with hope it will be useful.
